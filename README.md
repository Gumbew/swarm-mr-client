# swarm-mr-client
Python client module and console tool for SwarmMR cluster

To use it as a console tool:
* Create and activate python virtual environment in the root folder;
* Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all needed packages;
* Execute _client.py_ as a python script (pass `-h` or `--help` for help).

In addition you can import that file _client.py_ as a module and use it in your own python app.

*Additional info will be added here ASAP.*
